//    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
//    let age = 100;
//    let age2 = age;
//    console.log(age, age2);
//    age = 200;
//    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
//    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
//    team[0] = 'lulz';

    // now here is the problem!
//    console.log(players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[0] = 'lulz';
    console.log(team2, players);



    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };

    // with Objects
    // and think we make a copy:

//    const captain = person;
//    captain.number = 99;
//

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person);
    console.log(captain2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos'
        }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // deepClone()
    // JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
